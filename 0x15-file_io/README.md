# File Handling and System Calls

## Introduction
When working with files in a Unix-like environment, it's crucial to find reliable sources of information online. This README provides a brief guide to essential concepts and operations related to file handling.

## Basic File Operations
Learn how to create, open, close, read, and write files using system calls. Understand the fundamentals of file descriptors and their role in file I/O.

## File Descriptors
Explore the three standard file descriptors (stdin, stdout, and stderr) and their POSIX names. Gain insights into their purposes and how they interact with I/O operations.

## I/O System Calls
Master the use of I/O system calls: `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write`. These calls form the backbone of file manipulation, enabling you to perform various file-related tasks.

## File Access Flags
Understand the flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, and `O_RDWR` to control file access modes. Learn how to choose the right flag for your specific file manipulation needs.

## File Permissions
Grasp the concept of file permissions and discover how to set them when creating a file with the `open` system call. Ensure proper security measures are in place for your files.

## System Calls vs. Functions
Distinguish between system calls and functions. Understand the role of system calls in interacting with the operating system kernel, while functions often provide higher-level abstractions.

## Glossary
- **System Call:** A request made by programs to the operating system's kernel for essential operations.
- **File Descriptors:** Numeric identifiers representing open files or network connections.
- **File Permissions:** Settings that define who can access or modify a file, ensuring data security.
- **Flags:** Parameters passed to system calls, influencing their behavior during file operations.

Always refer to reliable online sources for comprehensive information and stay informed about best practices in file handling.
